# My Todo App
A basic todo app that will evolve over time. For now it is being written in vanilla Javascript.

[Link to Vanilla JS Todo Tutorial](https://codingthesmartway.com/building-a-vanilla-javascript-todo-app-from-start-to-finish-ep-3-styling-the-app/)
- Currently on Part 3 of that already.

## TODO
1. Finish Vanilla JS tutorial
2. Update code to use Typescript to be fancy
3. Upgrade to using Vue as a framework
4. *Optional* Implement a backend to be fancy

## Super fancy optional stuff
- Implement testing along the way
- Implement a proper CSS framework
